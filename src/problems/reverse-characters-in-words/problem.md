Given a string `sentence` containing words separated by single spaces, reverse the characters within each word and return the resulting string. The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, but the output should not. Words are defined as non-empty sequences of characters separated by spaces.

- The input string contains at least one word.
- Each word consists of non-space characters.
- You must return a string where the characters of each word are reversed, with a single space between words and no leading or trailing spaces.

Example:
- Input: "hello world code"
- Output: "olleh dlrow edoc"
- Input: "  the sky  is blue  "
- Output: "eht yks si eulb"
