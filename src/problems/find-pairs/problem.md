Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Return the answer in any order.

- The array `nums` contains at least 2 elements.
- Each element in `nums` is an integer.
- You must return an array of two indices.
